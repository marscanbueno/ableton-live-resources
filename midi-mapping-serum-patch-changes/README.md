# Midi Mapping Serum Patch Changes<a name="HOME"></a>

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Its been quite a struggle to figure out how exactly to midi map changing patches in [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) running through [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) using a midi controller on the web.  Since every link that i could find on the topic, simply led to another thread with no conclusive answer -- I am providing information on how I was able to accomplish this feat.

#### Please Note..

* This is one of many possible ways to handle Patch / Program Changes using [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) as VST within [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com).  This happens to be the most convenient way for me based upon my production workflow.  I hope that this helps you!

## Getting Started<a name="gettingstarted"></a>

### Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

- [x] **SOFTWARE / HARDWARE**
  - [x] **GET** [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com)
  - [x] **GET** [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum)
  - [x] **GET** A Midi Controller (ie: a Midi Keyboard)
  - [x] **GET** A Text Editor of your choice (ie: TextEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit, Brackets, Notepad++, etc)
  - [x] **GET** The CC or Note values that you desire to use for midi mapping your controller


- [x] **SKILLS REQUIRED**
  - [x] Navigating your file system
  - [x] Duplicating files
  - [x] Renaming files
  - [x] Editing files

- [x] **KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO FIRST**
  - [x] View the ```serum.cfg``` file before edits:  [serum.cfg.bak](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/Serum.cfg.bak)
  - [x] View the ```serum.cfg``` file after edits:  [serum.cfg](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/Serum.cfg)


### Setup and Configuration<a name="setup"></a>

1. Provided you have [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) and [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) pre-installed, navigate to the folder / directory that your ```serum.cfg``` preferences file is stored in.
  * ```serum.cfg``` is located in the following folder / directory depending on what operating system you are using:
    * **[MacOS]**:  ```~/Library/Preferences/Serum.cfg```
    * **[WindowsOS]**:  ```%APPDATA%/Xfer/Serum```
2. Before editing ```serum.cfg``` make a duplicate / backup file.  IÊ»ve made a duplicate and renamed it ```serum.cfg.bak```.  Feel free to name your backup whatever you want that will identify it to you as a backup.

3. Open ```serum.cfg``` in your text editor of choice.  My flavor of the month is [Brackets](http://brackets.io)!

4. We will now edit a few lines within ```serum.cfg``` to allow us to change presets using buttons on our hardware device.  We will need to know if we will be using buttons that transmit Midi CCs or Notes, and what their values are.  In the following example, I will use Midi CCs.
  1. Line 33:  replace ```X``` with ```1```.  
  
      * where it said:
  
      ```[X] enable/disable this section (1 for CC, 2 for NOTES)```
        
      * it should now read:
  
      ```[1] enable/disable this section (1 for CC, 2 for NOTES)```
      
  2. Line 34:  replace both of the ```X```'s with the desired CCs for your controller.  in this example i use ```34``` for my previous patch / preset, and ```35``` for next patch / preset.  substitute ```34``` and ```35``` with the values that are specific to your controller.
  
      * where it said:
      
      ```[X][X] (increment / decrement CC for Preset Changes)```

      * it should now read:

      ```[35][34] (increment / decrement CC for Preset Changes)```
  
5. Save your changes!
6. Open [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) and insert a new instance of [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) onto a new Midi Channel.  Enjoy your mapped patch / preset selector!

## Using or Not Using ProgramChanges.txt

There are two types of Program Changes that Serum supports.

* **Static / Dedicated / Fixed Lists** - Which basically means that you don't need to worry about changing the program change #'s if you add/remove presets to Serum, which you can assign (in a text file).  Static Lists default to Bank 1.
* **Dynamic Lists** - Which are program changes based on the folder/menu item location (using bank messages).  Dynamic Lists  default to Bank _X_ depending on the number of preset folders you have.

_While I prefer to scroll through my presets dynamically, as I frequently create or import new patches, you may find it useful to utilize a static list in a live performance scenario._

### ..taken from the Serum Forums..

_MIDI Program Changes (current implementation) info:_

_A file named ProgramChanges.txt can be created in "Serum Presets/System/"._
_This text file contains preset names, one per line, to instruct Serum what programs to load. they also contain subfolder location inside Serum Presets/Presets/_
_Here is an example file:_

```
Plucked/PL Mallety [SD].fxp
Seq/SQ Majestic [SD].fxp
```

_Then Serum will create this program change map on startup, and change to the appropriate program. Bank and Sub-Bank are ignored. Up to 128 programs are supported._
_In the above example, a Program Change of 1 would load PL Mallety, and a Program Change of 2 would load SQ Majestic._
_If you want you can make "comment lines" by beginning them with a semi-colon, and they will be ignored._

```
; this is my program change file
; Program Change 1: 
Plucked/PL Mallety [SD].fxp 
; Program Change 2: 
Seq/SQ Majestic [SD].fxp 
; end of my program change file
```

_Keep in mind that presets take a moment to load (about 1 second, or less, depending on amount of WT data) and Serum will not play during that loading period, so you should plan accordingly._

### ..which got me thinking, "there must be an easier way to do this!"

**Luckily there is!**

_Kind of.._

At least theres a quick and simple way to pull the bulk of the presets that are contained within a folder into a ```ProgramChanges.txt```.  Further editing can be done to streamline them down or to expand upon the presets that are contatined within the list to suit your taste.

#### **MacOS Users**
1. Open ```Terminal.app```
2. Decide which Preset folder you would like to use to build your ```ProgramChanges.txt``` file with.  As an example, I'll use _WBBL Bass Preset Pack 1_, though you could use any folder you'd like.
3. Paste the following command to navigate in Terminal to the _WBBL Bass Preset Pack 1_ folder.

  ```cd /Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/Presets/WBBL\ Bass\ Pack\ 1\ Presets/```

  _Alternatively you could use any other preset folder that you prefer.  Heres another example.._
  
  ```cd /Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/Presets/Featurecast_Serum\ Presets/```
  
4. Paste the following command to create ```ProgramChanges.txt```.

  ```ls -1 > /Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/System/ProgramChanges.txt```

5. Verify that the folder contents were copied into ```Program Changes.txt``` by pasting the following command to read the file..

  ```cat /Library/Audio/Presets/Xfer\ Records/Serum\ Presets/System/ProgramChanges.txt``` 
  
  _You should see output similar to this:_
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/wbblpresetlist.png "WBBL Preset List")
  
  _Or, if you followed the example using the Featurecast Serum Presets as an example, you might see something similar to this:_
  
  ![alt text](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/featurecastpresetlist.png "Featurecast Preset List")

6. Perform any edits necessary to your ```ProgramChanges.txt``` file that are necessary.

7. Now you can enjoy jamming out on your Static List of presets!
