# Midi Mapping Serum Patch Changes<a name="HOME"></a>

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Its been quite a struggle to figure out how exactly to midi map changing patches in serum running through ableton live using a midi controller online.  Since every link that i could find on the topic, simply led to another thread with no conclusive answer -- I am providing information on how I was able to accomplish this feat.

#### Please Note..

* This is one of many possible ways to handle Patch / Program Changes using Serum as VST within Ableton Live.  This happens to be the most convenient way for me.  Hope this helps you!

## Getting Started<a name="gettingstarted"></a>

### Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

- [x] **GET** [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com)
- [x] **GET** [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum)
- [x] **GET** A Midi Controller (ie: a Midi Keyboard)
- [x] **GET** A Text Editor of your choice (ie: TextEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit, Brackets, Notepad++, etc)

### Setup and Configuration<a name="setup"></a>

1. Provided you have Ableton Live and Serum pre-installed, navigate to the folder / directory that your ```serum.cfg``` preferences file is stored in.
2. Before editing ```serum.cfg``` make a duplicate / backup file.  IÊ»ve made a duplicate and renamed it ```serum.cfg.bak```.
3. Open ```serum.cfg``` in your text editor of choice.
4. We will now edit a few lines within ```serum.cfg``` to allow us to change presets using buttons on our hardware device.
