# Midi Mapping Serum Patch Changes<a name="HOME"></a>

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Its been quite a struggle to figure out how exactly to midi map changing patches in [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) running through [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) using a midi controller on the web.  Since every link that i could find on the topic, simply led to another thread with no conclusive answer -- I am providing information on how I was able to accomplish this feat.

#### Please Note..

* This is one of many possible ways to handle Patch / Program Changes using [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) as VST within [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com).  This happens to be the most convenient way for me based upon my production workflow.  I hope that this helps you!

## Getting Started<a name="gettingstarted"></a>

### Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

- [x] **SOFTWARE / HARDWARE**
  - [x] **GET** [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com)
  - [x] **GET** [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum)
  - [x] **GET** A Midi Controller (ie: a Midi Keyboard)
  - [x] **GET** A Text Editor of your choice (ie: TextEdit, TextWrangler, BBEdit, Brackets, Notepad++, etc)
  - [x] **GET** The CC or Note values that you desire to use for midi mapping your controller


- [x] **SKILLS REQUIRED**
  - [x] Navigating your file system
  - [x] Duplicating files
  - [x] Renaming files
  - [x] Editing files

- [x] **KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO FIRST**
  - [x] View the ```serum.cfg``` file before edits:  [serum.cfg.bak](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/Serum.cfg.bak)
  - [x] View the ```serum.cfg``` file after edits:  [serum.cfg](https://github.com/marscanbueno/ableton-live-resources/blob/master/midi-mapping-serum-patch-changes/Serum.cfg)


### Setup and Configuration<a name="setup"></a>

1. Provided you have [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) and [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) pre-installed, navigate to the folder / directory that your ```serum.cfg``` preferences file is stored in.
  * ```serum.cfg``` is located in the following folder / directory depending on what operating system you are using:
    * **[MacOS]**:  ```~/Library/Preferences/Serum.cfg```
    * **[WindowsOS]**:  ```%APPDATA%/Xfer/Serum```
2. Before editing ```serum.cfg``` make a duplicate / backup file.  IÊ»ve made a duplicate and renamed it ```serum.cfg.bak```.  Feel free to name your backup whatever you want that will identify it to you as a backup.

3. Open ```serum.cfg``` in your text editor of choice.  My flavor of the month is [Brackets](http://brackets.io)!

4. We will now edit a few lines within ```serum.cfg``` to allow us to change presets using buttons on our hardware device.  We will need to know if we will be using buttons that transmit Midi CCs or Notes, and what their values are.  In the following example, I will use Midi CCs.
  1. Line 33:  replace ```X``` with ```1```.  
  
      * where it said:
  
      ```[X] enable/disable this section (1 for CC, 2 for NOTES)```
        
      * it should now read:
  
      ```[1] enable/disable this section (1 for CC, 2 for NOTES)```
      
  2. Line 34:  replace both of the ```X```'s with the desired CCs for your controller.  in this example i use ```34``` for my previous patch / preset, and ```35``` for next patch / preset.  substitute ```34``` and ```35``` with the values that are specific to your controller.
  
      * where it said:
      
      ```[X][X] (increment / decrement CC for Preset Changes)```

      * it should now read:

      ```[35][34] (increment / decrement CC for Preset Changes)```
  
5. Save your changes!
6.  Open [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com) and insert a new instance of [Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum) onto a new Midi Channel.  Enjoy your mapped patch / preset selector!

## Using ProgramChanges.txt

..taken from the Serum Forums..

_MIDI Program Changes (current implementation) info:_

_A file named ProgramChanges.txt can be created in "Serum Presets/System/"._
_This text file contains preset names, one per line, to instruct Serum what programs to load. they also contain subfolder location inside Serum Presets/Presets/_
_Here is an example file:_

```
Plucked/PL Mallety [SD].fxp
Seq/SQ Majestic [SD].fxp
```

_Then Serum will create this program change map on startup, and change to the appropriate program. Bank and Sub-Bank are ignored. Up to 128 programs are supported._
_In the above example, a Program Change of 1 would load PL Mallety, and a Program Change of 2 would load SQ Majestic._
_If you want you can make "comment lines" by beginning them with a semi-colon, and they will be ignored._

```
; this is my program change file
; Program Change 1: 
Plucked/PL Mallety [SD].fxp 
; Program Change 2: 
Seq/SQ Majestic [SD].fxp 
; end of my program change file
```

_Keep in mind that presets take a moment to load (about 1 second, or less, depending on amount of WT data) and Serum will not play during that loading period, so you should plan accordingly._

..which got me thinking, "there must be an easier way to do this!"

**Luckily there is!  Kind of..**
